## üìù **Task Overview**  

You are required to create a **Delivery Weather Insights App** for Send24. The application will fetch weather data for given pickup and drop-off locations and provide recommendations for delivery feasibility. This task allows you to optionally use **Kotlin Multiplatform** for parts of the implementation.

---

## üöÄ **Requirements**  

### 1. **Core Features**  
1. **Input Fields**: Allow users to input pickup and drop-off locations.  
2. **Weather Data**: Fetch and display the following details for both locations:  
   - Temperature.  
   - Weather conditions (e.g., rain, clear skies).  
   - Wind speed (optional).  
3. **Delivery Recommendation**: Provide a recommendation based on weather conditions:  
   - "Safe for delivery" (e.g., clear skies, light rain).  
   - "Delay advised" (e.g., heavy rain, thunderstorms).  
4. **History**: Save the last 5 routes searched locally (Room or SharedPreferences).  

### 2. **Optional Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)**  
- Use a **shared Kotlin Multiplatform module** to handle weather data processing and recommendations.  
- Test the shared logic with unit tests.  

### 3. **User Interface**  
- Use **Jetpack Compose** or **XML layouts** to design a clean, responsive UI.  
- Display weather data and recommendations clearly.
