In this submission, I was able to configure the build.gradle files, implement the remote and local data layers for fetching weather data and saving history functionality, and set up the ViewModel to handle data flow. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I was unable to implement the presentation layer (UI) and some other vital parts of the project. The incomplete implementation was in my means to ensures compliance with the 2 hours and 30 minutes timeframe stated.
